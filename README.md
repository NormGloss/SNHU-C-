   "Corner Grocer" (source.cpp) is a program which will read an input file of grocery items, take a total count of each item, and write those totals to an output file.  It will also
  display the total for any requested item, all items and their totals, or a histogram of all items and their totals.  These options are accessed through a menu
  within the program.  I believe that I did a particularly good job in this program of creating the class.  Moving all of the map creation and manipulation to
  the class kept main sleek and easy to read.  Additionally, I feel that I created easy to read code with clear and concise comments.  The hardest part of writing
  this program was the minutia.  Making sure that the histogram printed out right, making sure that the map was being parsed correctly, etc.  When I came across
  a bug that I couldn't find or needed guidance with how to accomplish what I envisioned, I sought help from tutors.  I believe that the work I did with objects
  and classes will help me succeed as I delve deeper into my education and eventually career in computer science.  This program is maintainable, readable, and
  adaptable in large part due to the comments clearly stating what each component does.  This will allow the next programmer to find a nd fix/update any part of
  the application easily.
